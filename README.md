This repository contains a small React-based web game inspired by the "hacking" mini-game from the Fallout video game series. I originally wrote this in 2015 as a way to learn Javascript and React. I recently decided to go back and clean it up a little bit!

# Ideas for improvement
* Ability to click matching parentheses/brackets

* Keyboard Controls
