  <h2>How to play:</h2>
  <p>If you are familiar with Fallout 3 or 4, then this webpage should look a little familiar. The goal of this game is also somewhat similar to the tabletop game 'mastermind'. In essence, the point of the game is to guess the correct password. You can click on a word within the block of 'code', and it will show you how many letters are shared between the word that you guessed and the correct password. You have 4 attempts before it locks you out (and resets so you can try again... there's no reward aside from seeing your win/loss ratio at this point).
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the password was 'team', and you guessed 'meat', it would say that 2 out of 4 letters are correct (t<strong>ea</strong>m m<strong>ea</strong>t).</li>
    <li>If the password was 'potato' and you guessed 'tomato', it would say that 4 out of 6 letters are correct (p<strong>o</strong>t<strong>ato</strong> t<strong>o</strong>m<strong>ato</strong>).</li>
  </ol>
